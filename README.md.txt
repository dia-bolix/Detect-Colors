## Color Dectection

### Project Description
This python file allows you to get the name of a color when you click in an image.
It does so by comparing the RGB values of a clicked pixel to the nearest RGB color from a list of colors in a csv file.
The file requries an addition argument, -i, followed by the name of the image. It needs to be in the same folder as the python file.
